# KeepInMind
KeepInMind is an iOS application that allows the user to play a memory game with their own photos. It utilizes SwiftUI and Combine Frameworks with MVVM architecture. The app supports importing photos from the user's gallery or downloading them from Google Photos API. The photos are then used as the cards in the memory game.
